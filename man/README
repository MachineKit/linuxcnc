The Machinekit manual page documents are now in asciidoc format.

They are available on-line in html at www.machinekit.io/docs

If you require local rendering of the manuals in a terminal,
a script called `mank` has been added to the executables.

It requires the installation of elinks ( very light text browser )
and `asciidoctor` ( asciidoc to html converter )

These are available in packages of those names from standard
Debian repos.

Invoke with 
mank [name of component/utility/function]

eg.
mank axis-remote 
or 
mank debounce

(the .asciidoc extension is completed by the script)
