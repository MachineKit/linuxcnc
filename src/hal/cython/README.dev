For those changing the Cython bindings:

Rebuilding the Cython bindings requires Cython v. 0.19 or greater.  In
Debian Wheezy, this is available from `wheezy-backports`.

If a suitable Cython is not available, pre-compiled bindings will be
copied from the `hal/cython/machinekit/attic` directory.

To contribute Cython binding changes back to the Machinekit project,
check in changes to the `.pxd` and `.pyx` files as expected, and also
copy the generated `.c` files into the `attic` directory and check
those in, too.

This need will go away once newer Cythons are commonly available in
current distros.
